Hello! I'm Alex, recent Computer Science graduate at Carleton University. I am currently looking for new graduate positions.

The aspects of computer science that I am most interested in are its potential applications. I have seen firsthand the impact that well-designed websites and software can have on improving different areas of our lives. A long standing goal of mine is to contribute to projects that are accessible and revolve around causes that are important to me.

The areas I'm currently very interested in are: Accessibility, AI, Cloud Native, and Full Stack Web Development

Some of my personal interests include: music (I'm currently learning the electric guitar), working out, gaming, and building computers.
