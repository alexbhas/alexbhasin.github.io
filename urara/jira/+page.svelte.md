Recently, I've been looking for a to-do list application that allows me to keep track of my tasks and their progress. Having used Jira before in previous work positions, I have decided it would be a good idea to create my own personal Jira board. I'll be organizing my tasks under different labels and epics such as school, projects, etc. I'll be able to utilize the many features Jira offers to create a unique board that enables me to be more productive overall by ranking the difficulty and priority of tasks and including important details about them in their descriptions.
