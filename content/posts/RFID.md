This is a Python simulation for the COMP 4203 project, which replicates the work of Cheng and Jin's research paper, [Analysis and Simulation of RFID Anti-collision Algorithms](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4195229). The purpose of the project is to compare the performance of the Binary Tree RFID anti-collision algorithm against other anti-collision methods, specifically focusing on the effectiveness of the Binary Tree algorithm approach to tag identification and collision avoidance by evaluating the number of slots taken to differentiate all tags.
