java was the first programming language that i sunk a lot of time into. i haven't really touched it in like 4 years though.
i've been aware of kotlin for some time, and so i thought why not get back into the jvm, but through kotlin this time.

i've been sick for the past 2 weeks with a cold. i was laying down listening to a "sleepy game music" playlist. with every different song as my eyes were closed i kept imagining vivid dreamscapes, and the one that i remember most was of a red pyramid, it looked so cool, a huge red 3D pyramid that felt like it fit in a 90s cyberpunk aesthetic.

so now that we are in an age of accelerated learning through LLMs, i've decided to build a dungeon crawling game primarily using LWJGL.

it's called red pyramid, after my imagination's creation. in only a few days, i've managed to build the movement, map generation, and minimap features. i've also had some fun learning how to make sound effects, with a few simple ones in audacity. i'm looking into digital synth software to see if i can make more complex sounds though.

you can see some screenshots of what i have so far below. i'm keeping the repo private for now, but may open source it in the future.
