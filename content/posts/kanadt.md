I've recently taken up learning Japanese at a casual pace, trying to learn the syllabaries. I decided to see what sort of apps
were out there and decided to put the effort in to make the definitive app to help with learning hiragana and katakana.

The result is Kana DT. It allows you to study the different alphabets, and then quiz yourself on them. It is highly customizable and
you can tailor the app to quiz yourself on what you want to learn. I plan to add a lot more features later on.
