I've wanted to make my first real project with Svelte for quite some time now, since I have been learning it over the past few months. The idea I came up with was for MoodyMix, a web application that allows for users to get song recommendations based off selecting different emotions in a grid.

The app was built using Svelte for the front-end, and Python for the back-end (Flask). I'm using MongoDB as the main database, which stores all of the song information.
