This is a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good project! 

LarryDavid-Talkabot is a Python project that generates .wav files of Larry David's voice from Curb Your Enthusiasm. The bot uses OpenAI's davinci003 API and TorToiSe library to generate the audio. The main goal of the project is to showcase the capabilities of natural language processing and voice generation in Python.
